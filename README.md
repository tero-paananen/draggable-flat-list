# draggable-flat-list
React Native FlatList component those items can be drag into new position. This component **does NOT use** Reanimated https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-reanimated or React Native Gesture handler https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-gesture-handler and that is why this works also on React Native Windows.


Tested on platforms: Windows, iOS, (Android will be done)
