# draggable-flat-list

React Native FlatList component whose items can be drag into new position. This component **does NOT use** [React Native Reanimated](https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-reanimated) or [React Native Gesture Handler](https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-gesture-handler) and that is why this works also on React Native Windows.

Tested on platforms: Windows, iOS, (Android will be done)
